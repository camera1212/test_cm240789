<p>I began this project with no understanding of CSS or HTML. This is the first website I've fully built. 
I am hosting it on github so I can understand basic terminal commands. I'm using gitbash.</p>
<h3>my goals</h3>
<p>learn more about github and basic web development</p>
<p>incorporate a blog api</p>
<p>learn about the basics of web hosting</p>
<p><b>special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/webtuu/git_basics">Webtuu</a> for their helpful blog on git basics </b></p>
